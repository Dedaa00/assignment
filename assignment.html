            <p>Hi! &#128075 I go by the name  </i><b>FELICIA DEDAA BOAKYE. </b>
             <p>I am a first year </i><b>BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING STUDENT.</i></b>
            <p>My reference number is <b>21100977</b></p>

             <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
             <P>So, <b>biomedical engineering</b> is a field in engineering that deals with the combination of biology, 
             technology, medicine, and innovative ideas to improve the healthcare of humanity.
             Studying biomedical engineering opens a lot of career opportunities that help in improving and adding value
              to the lives of various individuals. Honestly speaking, biomedical engineering is one of the best engineering courses 
              to offer because aside from building innovative devices to improve people's lives, the money that the engineer makes is top-notch &#128524.</P>

            <h3>REASON  FOR STUDYING BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING</h3>
            <P>My reason for studying biomedical engineering, hmm... apart from the salary I will be earning (<b>which is a lot &#128526</b>),
            I have a strong desire to help people, so I thought of it since I studied a little bit of coding and robotics in high school (<b>which I enjoyed</b>) 
            and loved biology. Why don't I just merge both? So, through some research I did, I stumbled upon biomedical engineering&#128525. I continued
             my research on the program, and I fell in love with it, hence growing my love for the program. Mmm... I guess that the reason, apart form the money 
             that will be earned&#128524 why I'm studying biomedical engineering</P>
